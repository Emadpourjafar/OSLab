     Note: all of the arguments are pointers
     The first arg is a pointer to thread_id,
     the second arg is used to set some attributes for the new thread_id
     (if you use NULL it sets default values)
     the third is void* (*start_routine)(void*), accepts void* as an arg and also returns a void* as a rv
     what does it show? it indicates that is possible to pass an arbitrary piece of data to our new thread,
     and that our new thread can return an arbitrary piece of data when it finishes.
     how do we pass our thread an arbitrary argument? we use the fourth arg to call.
